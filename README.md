# BeSmart

BeSmart is our BizTech HelloHacks 2022 Hackathon project designed by Colin Chen, Anna Luo, Bonnie Qiu and Alex Wu. Our submission was awarded Best UX/UI Design out of 15 teams competing.

BeSmart is a prototype android app focusing on sending real-time notifications for individuals to answer preset questions. Players are required to submit an answer within a certain time period and will receive points to compete with friends and peers while simutaneously creating active learning.

The frontend interface was created using purely Figma and the backend used answerQuestions.py and createQuestionss.py.
